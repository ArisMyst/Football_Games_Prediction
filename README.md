Machine Learning Decision Tree and Random Forest to predict Premier League Games

Premier League Prediction Games based ion Half Time score. Steps
1.  Use the ''export.sql" files to create the database (mine is oracle)
2.  Use the .py files to create scrap data from transfermarkt or betting sites (in my case stoiximan.gr) to insert the odds for each game
3.  Use the other sql files to export the data (optional, you can use the PL_20200307 but it will up to date until Match 2020, you can get historical or up to date data from http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php)
4.  Use the .ipynb files to use the ML algorithms for prediction (Decision Tree and Random Forest)
